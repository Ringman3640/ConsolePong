# ConsolePong

Note: Contains a section of copied code. More information bellow.

An old personal project where I attempted to create a singleplayer pong in the console. This was before I learned that global variables were bad practice, so some aspects of my code do not follow standard coding styles. 

The console window can be resized to change the shape of the play area. In order to get the size of the window, I used a solution written by quantum on stackoverflow. It is commented the cpp file.
